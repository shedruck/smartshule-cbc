The segments in a  | URL normally follow this pattern:  |  | 	www.your-site.com/class/method/id/  |  | In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship  | so that a different class/function is called than the one  | corresponding to the URL.  |  | Please see the user guide for complete details:  |  |	http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html */$route['(email_templates)/view/(:any)'] = 'email_templates/view/$4';$route['(email_templates)/page(/:num)?'] = 'email_templates/index$2';
